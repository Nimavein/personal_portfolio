    "My name is Micha≈Ç and I'm currently studying Social Informatics at AGH, where I've been able to develop my UX design, data analysis and frontend skills by creating a number of academic projects. During last year's summer break I had the opportunity to gain my first commercial experience as a Frontend Developer during an internship at Masterborn Software, allowing me to develop my skills in a more structured way. Since December, I have been a Junior Frontend Developer at Nextrope, which is a chance for me to learn more about the Fintech and Blockchain environment. I develop web applications by building the frontend and integrating it with the blockchain and backend using mainly ReactJS, JavaScipt, TypeScript and Redux. In my spare time I like to play piano, swim and watch psychological movies with unconventional endings.";
